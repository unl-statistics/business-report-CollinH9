Variable of interest: WTMP = Water Temperature (degrees Celsius)\n\n\nA.1.2 Who collected the data\nThe data was collected and maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC).\n\n\nA.1.3 Why the data was collected\nNDBC stations provide operational marine observations to support weather forecasting, ocean monitoring, navigation safety, and climate research.\n\n\nA.1.4 What the data is about\nThe dataset contains time-series oceanographic observations from station DPHA1 located near Dauphin Island, Alabama (30.251°N, 88.078°W).\nKey variables relevant to this project:\n\nYY, MM, DD, hh, mm — date and time components\n\nWTMP (°C) — water temperature\n\nOther available variables include air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, pressure, and tide height.\n\n\nA.1.5 When the data was collected\nThe station provides multi-year historical observations. Data are typically recorded at 30-minute or hourly intervals. Historical records extend back multiple decades, allowing trend analysis.\n\n\nA.1.6 Where the data was collected\nDauphin Island Sea Lab station (DPHA1), Alabama, Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\nA.1.7 How the data was collected\nWater temperature is measured using in-situ oceanographic sensors mounted at the monitoring station. NOAA maintains and calibrates these instruments to meet operational standards.\n\n\nA.1.8 Structure of the data\nThe dataset is provided as a plain text or downloadable table format. Each row represents a timestamped observation. Columns represent meteorological and oceanographic variables.\n\n\nA.1.9 Formatting decisions and missing values\nMissing values are encoded using sentinel values such as 999, 99.0, or blank entries. These must be cleaned before analysis.\nWater temperature is recorded in degrees Celsius and will need to be converted to Fahrenheit to evaluate the 85°F operational threshold.\n\n\nA.1.10 Data validation\nQuality checks should include:\n\nPercentage of missing values in WTMP\nDetection of implausible values\nIdentification of gaps in the time series",

Each row represents one balancing authority-hour observation. Columns represent demand, generation, and related grid measures.\n\n\nA.2.9 Formatting decisions and missing values\nSome records may include imputed or adjusted values. The analysis must document whether raw or adjusted demand is used.\nTimezone differences between water temperature data and electricity demand data must be reconciled before merging.\n\n\nA.2.10 Data validation\nQuality checks should include:\n\nMissingness rates by balancing authority\nDetection of negative or implausible demand values\nTime continuity verification",
