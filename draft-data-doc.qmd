## 1) Gulf Water Temperature Data (Dauphin Island, AL)

### Dataset

Primary dataset: NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) station DPHA1
Variable of interest: `WTMP` = Water Temperature (degrees Celsius)

### Who collected the data

The data was collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC).

### Why the data was collected

NDBC stations provide operational marine observations to help with weather forecasting, ocean monitoring, navigation safety, and climate research.

### What the data is about

The dataset contains observations from station DPHA1 near Dauphin Island, Alabama.

Key variables relevant to this project:

- `YY, MM, DD, hh, mm` — date and time components  
- `WTMP` (°C) — water temperature  

### When the data was collected

Data is typically recorded at hourly intervals. Records go back back multiple decades, allowing trend analysis.

### Where the data was collected

Dauphin Island Sea Lab station (DPHA1), Alabama, Gulf of Mexico.

### How the data was collected

Water temperature is measured using sensors mounted at the monitoring station.

### Structure of the data

The dataset is provided as a table. Each row represents a timestamped observation. Columns represent variables of interest that can be made into graphs.

### Formatting decisions and missing values

Missing values are encoded using blank entries. These must be cleaned before analysis.

Water temperature is recorded in degrees Celsius and will need to be converted to Fahrenheit to evaluate the 85°F threshold.

## 2) Electricity Demand Data (Alabama / Southeast Region)

### Dataset

Primary dataset: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-930 Hourly Grid Monitor  
Variable of interest: `Demand (MW)` — actual electricity demand

### Who collected the data

The data was collected by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) through Form EIA-930 reporting from balancing authorities.

### Why the data exist

The dataset provides public transparency.

### What the data are about

The dataset contains hourly electricity demand and generation statistics for balancing authorities across the United States.

Key variables:

- `Balancing Authority`
- `Local Time at End of Hour`
- `Demand (MW)`
- `Demand Forecast (MW)`
- `Net Generation (MW)`

For this project, demand data for Alabama or the relevant balancing authority serving the Gulf region will be used.

### When the data were collected

Data is available on an hour to hour basis and updated daily. Historical data extends back multiple years.

### Where the data were collected

Reported at the balancing authority level covering Alabama and the Southeast region.

### How the data were collected

Balancing authorities report operational grid data to EIA through automated submissions under Form EIA-930.

### Structure of the data

The dataset is presented graphically, but it's available in many file formats such as CSV. Each row represents one balancing authority-hour observation. Columns represent demand, generation, and related grid measures.

## Relevance to Scenario

The NOAA water temperature dataset let's us estimate the frequency and duration of periods when Gulf water temperature exceeds 85°F.

The EIA electricity demand dataset allows us to see whether these high-temperature periods correlate with peak electricity demand.
